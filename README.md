# Draft charters for public review
This repo is a space for draft charters to be developed for W3C Working
Groups or Community Groups and discussed and refined. No charters that get
added here necessarily have any offical standing at all—anyone can create a
draft charter here for public discussion. If you’d like to have push access
to add a draft charter to the repo,
[file and issue requesting access](https://github.com/w3c/charter-drafts/issues).
