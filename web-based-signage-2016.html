      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
	<p>The group will develop APIs for user agents (“UA”s hereafter) embedded in digital signage terminal devices (“devices” hereafter).</p>

	<p>Two types of users exist. Device operators who remotely operate devices and Audiences who watch the devices. Device operators have access to UAs of devices. These operators typically do not have access to the devices physically. On the contrary, audiences, who are anonymous and in the general public, do not have control over devices.</p>

	<p>The signage UA should provide Remote Management API to be controlled by device operators.</p>

	<p>The operators want to manage the signage UA via their web console of the controlling device. Operators want to use the following functions:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Start/Stop the UA</li>
	    <li>Open/Close a page</li>
	    <li>Reboot the UA</li>
	    <li>Accept/Reject when the UA prompts for a user confirmation reuquired for security reasons</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p>These operations require protection mechanism to prevent unauthorized accesses.</p>

	<p>In addition to above functions, the WG will develop functions which enable web applications to access a set of functions in the underlying operating system, such as:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Reboot the terminal device at operating system level</li>
	    <li>Configure or query time or time synchronization parameters at operating system level</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p>Because,  rebooting at the operating system level is useful for some trouble or emergency cases, and configuring or refer to the operating system level clock, which web applications depend on, is important to achieve timing accuracies of presentations.</p>

	<p>The specifications produced by this Working Group will address security and privacy considerations based on a security model different from the traditional browser security model, because the device UAs controlled by the device operators rather than the audiences watching the devices. The considerations need to address the combination of both the UAs and the controlling device.</p>

	<p>Members of the Working Group should review other working groups' deliverables that identified as being relevant to the Working Group's mission.</p>

          <h3>
            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The working group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="web-foo" class="spec"><a href="#">Web Remote Management API</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Remote Management API consists of following functions:</p>

	      <dl>
		<dt id="web-rmapi-power-management" class="spec"><a href="#">Power Management</a></dt>
		<dd><p>This function enables web applications to access the signage terminal device’s power management system. Restarting the underlying web runtime or rebooting the underlying operating system is useful for some use cases. Restarting the underlying operating system and rebooting the device can be used for the basic trouble shootings. By studying the use cases, the function will be consulted for enhancement. The protocol and data format for controlling the terminal would also be considered for the further discussion.<p></dd>

		<dt id="web-rmapi-clock-management" class="spec"><a href="#">Clock Managementt</a></dt>
		<dd><p>This function enables web applications to get a precise time stamp for a signage terminal device showing content on a schedule and to allow synchronizing with another device. The timestamp object provides the same functions as the Date object specified in the ECMAScript, but its precision must be guaranteed at the specified level.<p></dd>

		<dt id="web-rmapi-remote-prompting" class="spec"><a href="#">Remote Prompting</a></dt>
		<dd><p>In a case of malfunctions or other signage terminal prompts requiring user interaction, an API needs to define to where the prompt needs to be shown because audiences of the signage terminal device cannot answer for the dialog. This function will be consulted with use case discussion.</p></dd>

		<dt id="web-rmapi-remote-prompting" class="spec"><a href="#">Other Contextual Information</a></dt>
		<dd><p>The other functions besides the above are needed to enable web applications to get system-wide information of the digital signage terminal, such as screen state (power, brightness, colorimetry, color temperature) and memory information (RAM usage). Moreover, it is useful for web applications to prepare such functions as service workers which can interact with any windows (context/domains) or context with a privilege to access any windows and origins. These functions will be considered in further discussion with use cases.</p></dd>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Web-based Signage Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web-based Signage Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[email-list]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
