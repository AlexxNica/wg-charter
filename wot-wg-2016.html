        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p><i class="todo">Brief background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry.</i></p>

<p>There is broad agreement about the huge potential for services for the Internet of Things (IoT), but this is being held back by fragmentation across many platforms, standards and a rapid evolution of the low level IoT technologies themselves. This Working Group will seek to define Web technology standards for an abstraction layer that sits on top of existing platforms and standards, and simplifies application development. The starting point is the idea of things that stand for physical or abstract entities, whether connected or not. These can be exposed to applications by software objects with data models describing the object’s properties, actions and events. These software objects can encapsulate local things, e.g. for sensors and actuators attached to the same device as an application script, or remote things, where the object acts as a proxy for a software object on another device.</p>

<p>The approach is based upon the fundamentals of Web architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>URIs for identifying things</li>
<li>A variety of protocols for accessing things, since no one protocol will be appropriate in all contexts</li>
<li>Linked Data for describing things as a basis for interoperability and discovery, playing an analogous role to HTML for web pages</li>
</ul>

<p>URIs can be used to access machine interpretable descriptions of things. These descriptions enable the automatic generation of scriptable objects, whose events, properties and actions correspond to those of the thing the object stands for. An object on one server can act as a proxy for an object on another server. Application developers are shielded from the implementation details of how objects are coupled, allowing platform developers to choose the transport protocols and communication patterns best suited to the context. Servers can be provided at a wide range of scales from microcontrollers to cloud-based server farms.</p>

<p><img style="margin-left:20%;width:60%" alt="diagram showing two servers, one acting as a proxy for the other" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0b3036918b192e7255d79cad51a81337f2beef07/687474703a2f2f7777772e77332e6f72672f323031352f30392f776f742d617263682e706e67" /></p>

<p>The diagram shows a thing on server A that acts as a proxy for a thing on server B which is coupled to a sensor and actuator. The proxy on server A could be set up by a script on that server, or by a script on server B. The latter is useful when server A is on the public Internet and server B is behind a firewall, and you want to provide public access to the thing from server A. Web page scripts can create local proxies for things on servers, subject to the protocols supported by Web browsers and the single origin security policy.</p>

<p>This Working Group will define Web technology standards to enable services that span IoT platforms on devices ranging from microcontrollers to cloud-based server farms, with a view to countering fragmentation, and enabling a global market of services and associated software tools. This is expected to drive down the costs and risks involved in developing services, and help realise the full potential for the IoT. In short, we seek to extend the Web from a Web of pages to a Web of things.</p>

<p>There are many possible applications across a wide range of domains, e.g. homes, offices, healthcare, cities, electrical grids, retail and manufacturing. The key to realizing the Web of Things is the metadata that provides the basis for semantic interoperability. This Working Group will focus on the metadata vocabularies that are useful across a broad range of application domains. In addition, we plan work on scripting APIs exposed to application developers, and bindings to common protocols in collaboration with the standards development organizations responsible for those protocols.</p>

<p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The following needs lots of discussion as the raw material was too vague and lacked explanation</p>

<h3>Thing Descriptions</h3>

<ul>
<li>A Linked Data vocabulary for describing things in terms of the data models they expose to applications. This will include datatypes, integrity constraints, and provision for early and late binding. This cross domain vocabulary will be designed for use in combination with vocabularies for domain specific semantics and metadata. Consideration will be given to the means for describing the stability of data models and metadata, and how they evolve over time. This is needed to manage inter dependencies, and is analogous the role of metadata for package management in the Linux operating system.</li>
<li>A Linked Data vocabulary for security metadata as a basis for platforms to determine how to securely interoperate. This will build upon emerging best practices for securing IoT platforms. This is extremely vague and needs much greater precision</li>
<li>A Linked Data vocabulary for communications metadata. This will enable platforms to determine how to interoperate given a choice of protocols, data formats and encodings, as well as different communication patterns, e.g. push, pull, pub-sub and peer to peer. Communications metadata may be needed to describe the multiplexing of data from different sensors, different approaches to buffering data, and the interoperability requirements for communicating with battery or ambient powered devices that spend a lot of their time asleep to conserve power.</li>
<li>Serialization formats and encondings for metadata suitable for processing on resource constrained platforms and designed to appeal to application developers. This includes the definition of standard terms and their bindings to URIs in the Resource Description Framework, so that it isn't necessary for resource constrained platforms to dereference these terms when constructing the software objects corresponding to the data models for things. Where practical this will be based upon existing formats and encodings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scripting APIs</h3>

<p>The Working Group will seek to specify a suite of APIs exposed to applications covering the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discovery for local and remote cases <i class="todo">(to be expanded - waiting for input from Soumya &amp; Louay)</i></li>
<li>Cross platform security frameworks including provisioning, updates, authentication, and secure communication <i class="todo">(this is a place holder and to be rewritten - waiting for input from Oliver)</i></li>
<li>Thing lifecycles, e.g. registering and creating things, and enabling applications to be aware of lifecycle transitions</li>
<li>Cross cutting concerns, e.g. internationalisation, accessibility and privacy</li>
<li>Error handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Where practical, APIs will be defined in ways that are independent of the choice of programming languages.</p>

<h3>Bindings to Common Protocols</h3>

<p>To enable interoperability, the Working Group will seek to define standard bindings to common protocols. This includes the mapping between thing data models and protocol resource models, the relationship between communication patterns and interaction models, and guidelines to standards development organisations for mapping the web of things to their protocols.</p>

          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this working group.</p>

            <li>Application &amp; domain specific metadata vocabularies</li>
            <li>Definition of protocol bindings without the collaboration of the standards development organisations responsible for those protocols</li>
            <li>APIs and security frameworks specific to particular platforms external to the W3C</li>
            <li>URI mappings for non-resourceful protocols</li>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review before FPWD and CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response from the horizontal group. This compromise offers early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
