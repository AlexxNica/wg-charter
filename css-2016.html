      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p><i class="todo">Brief background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry.</i></p>

<p class="issue css"><b>issue:</b> Copied from previous charter, but shortened by 
removing later explanatory paragraphs.</p>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that allows
authors and users to attach style (e.g., from fonts and spacing to
filter effects and style animations) to structured documents (e.g., HTML
documents and XML applications). By separating the presentation style of
documents from the content of documents, CSS simplifies Web authoring
and site maintenance. It supports media-specific style so that authors
may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural
devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc.

        </p><p>The CSS WG develops the following, somewhat independent
          technologies, all of which are in scope for the CSS Working Group:

        </p><ul>
          <li>A <strong>syntax</strong> for associating information
            with elements in a structured resource, in particular HTML
            and SVG documents. The main part of the syntax consists of
            rules that associate properties + values with selectors
            where the selectors are expressions that match elements in
            the structured document, based on their position in the
            document or based on other information about the elements
            (their type, what the user has done with them, etc.)

          </li><li>A <strong>processing model,</strong> referred to as
            “cascading and inheritance,” that ensures that, given
            one or more style sheets and a structured document, each
            element in the document is associated with the full set of
            properties and values, no matter how short the style sheets
            or how long the document.

          </li><li>A <strong>rendering model,</strong> part of which is a
            model of typography, i.e., a layout model for text
            documents, possibly with embedded other objects and
            possibly involving several documents simultaneously.
            The model describes blocks and lines of text, characters,
            columns, colors, dynamic effects, etc. Another
            part is rendering to speech. It also
            includes the presentation and behavior of UI widgets. CSS's
            influence over UI controls is limited to defining shortcut
            keys, the look of controls in various states during
            interaction (valid/invalid, required, inactive, etc.),
            hiding/unhiding, and other local behaviors, but CSS does
            not itself change the state of elements and does not define
            how (form) elements interact with a server. (The general
            principle is that CSS can enhance the user's interaction
            with a document, but the document is functional without
            it.)

          </li><li>The <strong>CSS Object Model,</strong> a set of standard
            APIs, to which libraries can be written for manipulating
            style sheets and documents with associated style
            information.
        </li></ul>
		
		<p>The CSS WG not only develops CSS, but also checks that
          properties needed by other working groups and which could
          occur in a style sheet together with CSS properties, are
          compatible with CSS in general and consistent in their naming
          schemes. This affects properties such as those of SVG and
          Device Independence (such as media features), but not
          properties such as those in STTS nor the presentation
          attributes of XSL, SVG or DFXP.

        </p><p>Part of the work of the working group is also to develop
          test suites for the various specifications it publishes.

        </p><p>Another part is to maintain errata and, when needed, publish
          revised versions of the various specifications.</p>

          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p><i class="todo">For specifications of technologies that directly impact user experience, such as content technologies, as well as protocols and APIs which impact content: </i>Each specification should contain a section describing known impacts on accessibility to users with disabilities, ways the specification features address them, and recommendations for minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.</p>

        <h2>
          Deliverables
        </h2>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> I've removed the milestones table, which is always wildly inaccurate, and included the milestones as projected completion dates in the description template for each deliverable. Up-to-date milestones tables should be maintained on the group page and linked to from this charter.</p>
		

        <p>More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules are available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">group publication status page</a>.</p>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>

          <p>This list is not exclusive: The WG may also create new
  specifications, within its scope.</p>

		which we need to review and then add to this section. It will be longer in the new format.
		Last charter carefully avoided any mention of dates;
		new template has "expected completion date".</p>
		
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review before FPWD and CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response from the horizontal group. This compromise offers early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>
      	
      	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, 
          participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">CSS Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
		<p class="issue css">The above is from the new charter template. It seems odd to require a list of issues and actions on the WG
			page, and the current WG page has little info apart from a public participants list. Suggest we modify the above to say 
			issues are on github, and not claim everything is on one WG page.</p>
        <p>
          Most CSS Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, 
          and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work via the 
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues">GitHub issues list</a>, with 
          more general discussion on the public mailing list 
          <a id="public-name" href="mailto:www-style@w3.org">www-style@w3.org</a> 
          (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">archive</a>). The public is 
          invited to review and discuss issues, and to post messages to this list.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at 
          the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in 
          special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
